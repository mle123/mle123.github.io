The last two weeks-ish of September and the first few days of October this year marked the blooming of many fungi fruiting bodies in Hardtberg. Walking in the Derletal today I saw way fewer shrooms than I'd been seeing, after a cold and rainy weekend, and litter clearing activity by the Stadt in the Tal. 
It started with the Agarics, as it always does here, and the Xerocomus. On the 1st October Sulphur Tuft was just beginning, yellow buds along the backbone of fallen trunks. By the weekend stumps were aglow with it in the Tal, the Hardtbergwald and the Waldville between Alfter and Swisttal. Never seen so many Coprinus comatus. Millions of Mycena, Marasmius and finally found the alliacea on the 1st. I missed its burnt garlic stink. Brown, orange and violet Cortinarius, white spermatic Inocybe early and common too along paths. Paxillus, Lepiota, Pholiota, Entoloma, Tricholoma, Hebeloma, Lactarius red grey orange all over (deliciosus in the garden of the JuZe stand uncollected by their pine, pubescens - maybe - near the horses by its birch), Russula red purple green-grey, Leccinum, Suillus, Suillelus, Ramaria, Clitocybe odora and nebularis. Rooting shank. Macrolepiota up on the plateau. So many agarics, including two giant Princes under oak. Coprinopsis picacea as tall as my knee. Hygrophorus eburneus smelling of hyacinth. Coprinellus micaceus and disseminatus.
The Amanitas began on the last day of September in the Derletal: rubescens first, pantherina, phalloides - worryingly quite a few lining the path in the Derletal by the highest pond - muscaria, vaginata, I think spissa.
Giant puffballs in the undergrowth under trees which seemed unusual in the Derletal and the forest beyond. Otherwise few puffballs so far. Cyathus striatus.
Today, the 6th October, a first Helvella crispa.
I'm still missing amethyst deceivers, trooping funnel, Boletus, Armillaria and Lepista.
