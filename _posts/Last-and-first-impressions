If I close my eyes I can just about conjure myself back to the Derletal (Manderley?) and to my daily paths there, trodden over the past months, despite now, having taken a southward leap of over one thousand km or 8 degrees of latitude, being in another ecosystem entitrely. 
in my last days in the Derletal before flight, it finally felt as though there were a good few butterflies of different species: Speckled Wood, whites, Red Admiral and Purple Emperor (Napoleonic vibes). We saw a hare running up and down the fence in the Hardtberg Bad carpark, looking like it wanted into the military complex. I hadn't thought of it hefore, but it probably has regularly mown extensive fields there, for aircraft and so maybe good habitat for hares. Anyway it was good to see a large-ish mammal there, the first besides ubiquitous Homo sapiens and Canis lupus familiaris. 
I was pleasantly surprised to find I couldn't see any change or damage to the place despite hosting a small music festival at the end of June. A bit more litter and the grass in the meadow a bit yellowed from having stalls and beer wagons blocking its sun. The songthrush was back singing in thrbalders even. I didn't manage to see the toadlings before leaving/after the Fest.
